what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice / attitude comes from the owners/n of this establishment .
this establishment/n really made a marked decline after ( and this is recurring story ) the airing of food televisions " diners , drive - ins , and dives " hosted by guy fieri , in which schooner or later was subject of .
perhaps now , scooner/n or/n later/n falls into the " dive " category .

we had a very hard time getting the waitress/n ' attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to a manager .
as it turns out the owner/n was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered a token 20 % discount on our bill .

i went home & looked them up online again where i discovered there is a link for a give away that does n't work so emailed the restaurant/n about the non existent service & deceptive link .
after sitting at the bar for over 20 minutes the bar/n keep/n had made only 2 drinks & kept telling us she 'd be right with us .
we left without ever getting service/n .

after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by a waitress/n , a polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant .
a brief conversation with the manager/n at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment -- to say we had been " blown off " would be an understatement .
the manager/n continually interrupted with " is there anything else i can do for you ? " , a strange comment because she had hardly listened , let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience .
you are with a hot date and he / she has an urge for sushi/p ... then this might be the place .
the fish/p was fresh , though it was cut very thin .

to start off , approximately 8 - 10 oz of orange/n juice/n will cost you $ 3 .
they serve it in a tall , skinny hour - glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you a getting a small juice/n at the price of a half gallon in a supermarket .
i should have just asked for the check when i saw that ; but their menu/p was so unique that i continued .
the pancakes/p were certainly inventive but $ 8.50 for 3 - 6 " pancakes ( one of them was more like 5 " ) in the pancake flight ( sample of 3 different pancakes ) is well over - priced .
the pancakes/n should be larger ( at least 8 " ) to justify the expense even with the unique offerings .
