judging from previous posts this used to be a good place/n , but not any longer .
we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff/n acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .
the food/n was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .

i had never had edamame/p pureed/p before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could 've used a bit more salt ) .
the decor is night tho ... but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling ... its quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place/n look sleek and modern .

do n't judge this place/p prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .
the food/0 is decent .
however , it 's the service/n that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self - respect , which includes not letting a waiter/n intimidate me , i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .
this place/p has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area .
food/p is great .
service/p is top notch .
i tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea/p urchin/p , which was heavenly at sushi rose .
the sushi/p seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .
the rice/p to/p fish/p ration/p was also good -- they did n't try to overpack the rice .
we took advanatage of the half/p price/p sushi/p deal/p on saturday so it was well worth it .

the service/n varys from day to day- sometimes they 're very nice , and sometimes not .
the kitchen/n however , is almost always slow .
also , specify if you like your food/n spicy- its rather bland if you do n't .
the ambience/p is pretty and nice for conversation , so a casual lunch here would probably be best .
if you 've ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view/p the chart house has to offer .
add to that great service/p and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .

first of all , this place/n is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch 's editorial review .
the tables/n are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .

the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine/n list/n is simply overpriced .
slightly above average wines/n start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .
service/n is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service/n .
to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food/p , which was above average , but could n't make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .

the service/n was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .
the waitress/n , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .
after dinner the manager/n grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from ... maybe you do nt know how things work in america ... and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .
we did tip , i guess the model/ waitress/n just wanted more and complained to the manager .

price and quality of fish/n alone will keep us from making a return visit .
was n't going to share but i feel obligated ... while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef/n accidentally drop a piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing .
this place/p , which is only a few months old , is perhaps queens ' biggest secret !

we were seated outside and the waiter/n spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date .
one would think we 'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead , we got a snobby waiter/n would n't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so .
with so many good restaurants on the uws , i do n't need overpriced food/n , absurdly arrogant wait - staff who do n't recognize they work at a glorified diner , clumsy service , and management that does n't care .

personal/p pans/p are the perfect size for those hungry nights .
there is a downside if you 're ordering in -- the delivery/n guys/n have major attitude .
never have i had such dramatic delivery/n guys/n ( a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b / c i live in a walkup ) who always seem disappointed with their tips .

the pizza/p was pretty good and huge .
we were 4 and got the family size penne/p a/p la/p vodka/p which was tremendously gigantic portion ... a bucket of food literally .
the pasta/n penne/n was pretty extra buttery , creamy which means a big task to diggest .. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count , penne ... got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed ... lol
la/p rosa/p waltzes in , and i think they are doing it the best .
