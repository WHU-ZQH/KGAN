gross food/n – wow-
i ca n't remember the last time i had such gross food/n in new york .
my quesadilla/n tasted like it had been made by a three - year old with no sense of proportion or flavor .
and $ 11 for a plate of bland guacamole/n ?
do n't get me started on the margaritas/n , either .
oh , and i never write reviews -- i just was so moved by how bad this place/n was , i felt it was my duty to spread the word .

this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros/p in new york .
what really makes it shine is the food/p , which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices , and all made in - house ( even the gyro meat and sausages ) , and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected .

short and sweet – seating/p is great : it 's romantic , cozy and private .

i showed it to the manager/p , and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts ( but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for ) .
the manager/n finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine ( which cost less than the food ) , and made it seem like a big concession .

this establishment/p is the real deal .
wish ny had more of these kind of places : intimate , superb food/p , homey , top notch all the way around , certainly worth the wait .
but $ 500 for a dinner/n for/n two/n that did n't include wine ?
look , the appetizers/p were really good .
the entree/p was also very good .
what you are paying for is the environment/0 and the name .
yes , the place/p is classy and beautiful , but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while .
vanison/0 was good but not amazing .
bison/p was quite excellent however .
dessert/n : pure disaster .
i read reviews that called the restaurant/n too expensive and i thought to myself , but may be it is worth it .
the/0 four/0 seasons/0 has history and it is a sort of landmark of new york city restaurants , but trust me , they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say " i 've been to the four seasons restaurant " .
all in all , the food/p was great ( except for the dessserts ) .

you would think they would make up for it with service/n , sadly , no .
service/n was just ok , it is not what you 'd expect for $ 500 .
i agree that dining at casa/n la/n femme/n is like no other dining experience !
i literally just got back home after visiting casa/n la/n femme/n and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time .
we did arrive late for our reservation so i can not complain too much about the wait/0 for a table .
the place/p is beautiful !
the hostess/p was very pleasant .
however , our $ 14 drinks/n were were horrible !
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter/n kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka .
after the 4th time i asked again and the waiter/n than said after our dinner .
we asked for sides which the waiter/n than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order .
my chicken/n was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin .
i would not expect this for a $ 55 dinner/n .
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner , which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food/n and belly dancers !
if it seemed possible to do so while there i would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal/n was inedible !
i have never left a restaurant/n feeling as if i was abused , and wasted my hard earned money .
the menu/0 is fairly simple without much descriptions .
there was no tap beer/n that evening , which was a disappointment .
not much of a selection/n of/n bottled/n beer/n either , we went with brahma .
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried/p oysters/p and/p clams/p were delicious but a tiny portion ( maybe 3 of each ) .
the lobster/0 knuckles/0 ( special of the day ) were ok , but pretty tasteless .
i believe there were 2 shrimp in the "/n salt/n encrusted/n shrimp/n "/n appetizer/n .
i had the thai/p style/p fried/p sea/p bass/p ... which was very good .
everyone seemed generally happy with their food/p , except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi , seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice !

great indian/p food/p
food/p was amazing - i love indian food and eat it quite regularly , but i can say this is one of the best i 've had .
very " normal indian/0 food/0 " , but done really well .
i have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price ( just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $ 25 ) , which i would expect at a upscale indian restaurant but this place/p does n't have an upscale feel .

however , once i received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair , ( sometimes you have to settle when it 's your only option ) , i got through about half my kimchee/n before i found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting , slimy , clearly bad piece of fish skin .

my main concern was the sanity of the food/n that was being sent out to myself and others , but i would be lying is i said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen i was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation .
my girlfriend , being slightly more aggressive , and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal/n , called back only to be informed that i was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster , and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant .
it was n't as if this restaurant/n had any major bragging points before hand , but now it 's simply repulsive .

the real problem i had with this place was the complete lack of service/n .
my wife had barely touched that mess of a dish/n .
the wife had the risotto/p which was amazing .
the farro/p salad/p and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty .

love this place/p , every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go .
a quintessential slice/0 of/0 nyc/0 pizza/0 .
the crust/p has a great bite and a good chew , the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it , the salt from the cheese is great , really heightens the flavor of all the other components .

possibly the most romantic restaurant/p in the city
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern/p japanese/p brasserie/p ( that do n’t serve sushi ) , and in my opinion , one of the most romantic restaurants in the city !
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot/0 , once you enter the unmarked wooden doors , the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you ’re no longer in the city .

if you ’re planning to come here , make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ’ll be ushered to private/p booths/p where there will be no people or food watching ( choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky ! ) .

it ’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘ excuse me’ before the waiter/p opens the little curtain to your booth !
my party had the bbe/p $/p 29/p fixe/p prix/p menu/p , which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake !
we started off with a delightful sashimi/p amuse/p bouche/p .
i picked the grilled/p black/p cod/p as my entree , which i absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better .

the entrees/0 were served with miso soup and rice .
the sake/p ’s/p complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world .
for desserts , we tried the frozen/0 black/0 sesame/0 mousse/0 ( interesting but not extraordinary ) and matcha ( powdered green tea ) and blueberry cheesecake , which was phenomenal .

maybe it was the great company ( i had friends visiting from philly – yes , it was not a date this time ) or the super reasonable price point , but i just ca n’t say enough good things about this brasserie/p .
i do n’t usually visit the same establishment more than once , what more twice , but i ’ll come to zenkichi/p anytime for a quiet , unhurried and memorable dinner .
the service/n leaves much to be desired , from feeling like you are rushed the place your order , to being ignored the rest of the night .
they are extremely rude , not even apologizing for the horrible service/n we got and handing us a bill well over $ 500 for some drinks adn their pita bread !

i tried a couple other dishes/0 but was n't too impressed .

the food/p tasted very good .
the family/p seafood/p entree/p was very good .
the main/p entree/p was also very good .
price is high but the food/p is good , so i would come back again .
this place/n does n't make any sense
this place has totally weird decor/n , stairs going up with mirrored walls - i am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional ...

over all it was a very nice romantic place/p .
a coworker and i tried pacifico/p after work a few fridays and loved it .

our waitress/0 was n't mean , but not especially warm or attentive either .
i must say i am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant/p earlier in the year , though .
regardless , we 'll be back and ca n't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio/p .
the servers/n at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention .
a different server/n enhanced the fun , dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer ( which was delicious ) .

overall the food/p quality was pretty good , though i hear the salmon is much better when it has n't sat cooling in front of the guest .

how is this palce/n still open ?
everything was going good until we got our meals/n .
i took one look at the chicken/n and i was appalled .
it was served with skin , over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach/n and mashed potatoes .
i took one bite from the $ 24 salmon/n , and i have never , in the 17 years i have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy , as dry , and as bland as the one in flatbush farms .
at this point , the waitress/n comes over and asks us if everything was okay , i was literally so shocked that i was speechless and did n't say anything , and guess what , the waitress walked away .
so , i switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe i could stomach the meat and spinach/n again , but the spinach was so undercooked that i just could not bite through it .
this is where it really really gets bad : the manager/n said , there is absolutely nothing we can do , it 's a matter of taste that she did n't like it , and i can not comp it .
the manager/n came to the table and said we can do what we want , so we paid for what we did enjoy , the drinks and appetizers , and walked out .

each time we 've been , the front of house staff ( not the waiters/p - they 're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you ) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes i would never return .

as bfc/n does n't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated , which can be over an hour later !

the frizzy retro girl/n ( with winged/ dame edna glasses ) will yell at you if you try to order a drink .
i 'd be horrified if my staff/n were turning away customers so early and so rudely !
there 's another girl/n who i ca n't describe , she is about 5'6 " with brown hair , who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said , so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you 're * really * talking about .
considering you will spend at least $ 60 a head , i expect better service/n .

while finishing our meals which included a high - end bottle/p of/p wine/p , our son 's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert .
this guy refused to seat her and she left , followed shortly by the four of us , but not before i told him that in my 40 years of world travel , including paris , that i had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman/n in a restaurant .
a word to the wise : you ca n't dine here and disturb the maitre/n -/n d/n 's sense of " table turnover " , as whacked as it is , or else .

do n’t go to this place/n !
had an awful experience at casa/n la/n femme/n on a saturday dinner .
the manager/n was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly .
ca n’t believe how an expensive nyc restaurant/n can be so disrespectful to its clients .

the hostess/n was rude and i got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us .
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender/n disappeared .
i asked for a menu and the same waitress/n looked at my like i was insane .
i was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress/n said , " can i help you " and " how many are in your party . "
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff/n and non - existent customer service .

the waiter/n delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand .
the waitress/n came to check in on us every few minutes , and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating ( a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere , so i try to ignore it ) .
